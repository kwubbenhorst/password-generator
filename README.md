# password-generator
An webapp to generate a criteria-specific password

## Description: 
This web application was created to help employees with access to sensitive data generate strong, random passwords based on criteria they've selected. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. The user interface has a responsive design. The most challenging part of this build was to create a pool of characters -- only those characters the user had selected -- from which to pull out random characters -- as many as the user had indicated was their desired password length -- ensuring that at least one character of each chosen type was represented in the randomized result. The other challenge was to meet the given design specs, causing the prompts to recur until correct input was given. For instance the password needed to have numbers. Users were given no choice about that. It needed to have some letters, but the user could opt to include just lower case, just upper case or both. And the user had free choice whether or not to include symbols. The password length had to be between 8 and 128 characters (the exact length was user selected). Aesthetically the agreed upon design was very basic. While the chief concern was that this application actually function as it is supposed to, I couldn't resist adding in a gif to give this dynamic application a dynamic look and feel. In future perhaps the application could be redesigned away from the use of prompt dialogue boxes, which are ponderous, and toward the use of modals or drop down lists which would add to efficiency and elegance.

This application was authored by Karla Wubbenhorst, using some sourcecode provided by the Module 3 Challenge of the EdX Bootcamps curriculum.  MDN and W3Schools documentation was consulted for help with while loops and the use of the Math object (its floor and random methods).
